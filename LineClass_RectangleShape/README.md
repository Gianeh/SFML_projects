**Just a simple Line object that I created for other small projects.**

This class uses a RectangleShape object (from SFML/Graphics.hpp) to render a reusable and flexible Line I needed for many other simple concepts.
The code may contain mistakes and is not the **"Definitive LINE"** but it works smoothly enough for my current needings. I will accept any kind of review as long
as the code doesn't change completely. In case of more efficient alternatives I'll consider to write a second Class.
